# Crosscheck with Cherenkov-telescope H.E.S.S. CT5

## Abstract
To crosscheck the tools and algorithms used in the simulation for the Cherenkov-plenoscope, we perform a crosscheck with an existing Cherenkov-telescope. We choose to compare with the 5th telescope named 'CT5' in the [High Energy Stereoscopic System](https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/hfm/HESS/) as it is the largest Cherenkov-telescope in 2020. Here we collect CT5's public information to feed our simulations.

### Periode
I choose the periode of CT5 after its upgrade to a FlashCam image-sensor in mid 2019.
Internal name of this periode:
```
phase2d0 to
phase2d1
```

### Site
Namibia, Khomas Highland, Goellschau.
